# Next.js Link Migration Summary

## Issue
Next.js has updated its Link API, and using `<a>` tags as direct children of `<Link>` components is no longer supported unless you explicitly add the `legacyBehavior` prop. 

## Changes Made
1. Fixed `<Link>` component usage in `client/pages/404.tsx`:
   - Changed nested `<a>` tags to use the className directly on the `<Link>` component.

2. Fixed `<a>` tag usage in `client/PageComponents/AuthorPage/AuthorThree.tsx`:
   - Replaced standalone `<a>` tags with `<span>` elements with appropriate styling.
   - Added `cursor-pointer` class to maintain the interactive appearance.

3. Created utility scripts for fixing and detecting Link issues:
   - `client/scripts/fix-link-issues.js`: Fixes specific Link issues in AuthorThree.tsx
   - `client/scripts/fix-nextjs-links.js`: General-purpose script to detect and fix Next.js Link issues across the project

## Best Practices for Next.js Links
When using Next.js `<Link>` component, follow these guidelines:

1. **Modern API (Next.js 13+):**
   ```tsx
   <Link href="/about" className="your-class">About Us</Link>
   ```

2. **Legacy API (with legacyBehavior prop):**
   ```tsx
   <Link href="/about" legacyBehavior>
     <a className="your-class">About Us</a>
   </Link>
   ```

3. **When to use `<span>` instead of `<a>`:**
   - For non-navigational clickable elements, use `<span>` with appropriate styling
   - Add `cursor-pointer` class to maintain visual indication of interactivity

## Validation
All TypeScript type checks and build processes are passing successfully after these changes.

## Additional Recommendations
1. Add a linting rule to catch improper Link usage in future development
2. Consider running the `fix-nextjs-links.js` script as part of your CI/CD pipeline or pre-commit hook to automatically catch and fix Link issues
