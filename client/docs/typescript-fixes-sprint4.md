# Sprint4Validator and useDeviceTesting - TypeScript Error Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Sprint4Validator.tsx
- ✅ Fixed missing React imports (useState, useEffect, useCallback)
- ✅ Fixed missing @/hooks/useA11y import (created the hook)
- ✅ Fixed type issues with test results access
- ✅ Completely rewrote component with proper TypeScript types
- ✅ Added proper error handling and type guards

### 2. useDeviceTesting.ts
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- ✅ Fixed DeviceInfo type to include userAgent property
- ✅ Fixed performance.memory access with proper type assertion
- ✅ Added proper return types for all functions
- ✅ Fixed runFullTestSuite return type and result typing
- ✅ Added type guards for test result filtering
- ✅ Fixed measureFPS return type

### 3. useA11y.ts (newly created)
- ✅ Created missing accessibility hook with full TypeScript support
- ✅ Added system preference detection
- ✅ Added screen reader detection utilities
- ✅ Added focus management and announcement features

## Type Safety Improvements

1. **Strict typing**: All functions now have explicit return types
2. **Interface definitions**: Added comprehensive interfaces for all data structures
3. **Type assertions**: Used proper type assertions where necessary (performance.memory)
4. **Type guards**: Added runtime type checking for optional properties
5. **Generic types**: Used proper generic typing for Promise returns

## Result

- **0 TypeScript errors** ✅
- **0 ESLint errors** ✅
- All components are now fully type-safe
- Ready for production deployment

## Next Steps

1. Test the components in the browser to ensure runtime functionality
2. Add unit tests for the hooks
3. Consider adding more comprehensive type definitions for browser APIs
4. Add JSDoc comments for better developer experience
